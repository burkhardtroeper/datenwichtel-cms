# Datenwichtel-cms

Work in progress

This is a Nodejs-based CMS for my Data-Science-Blog-Page datenwichtel.de

It will have a admin-backend with user-auth, comments, status-control of the content, etc.

Database is MongoDB.

Database and backend are in Docker containers for easy Dev-Ops procedure :-)
